# EthiCopy Privacy, Integrity & Ethics (PIE) Protocol

Transparency is our product. We operate under the **"Anti-Dark Pattern Manifesto"**, ensuring that our platform is as ethical as the copy it generates.

---

## 🛡️ Data Integrity Standards
1.  **Zero-Retention Policy**: We do not store original marketing copy inputs for model training without an explicit Enterprise Opt-in.
2.  **Encryption at Rest & Transit**: All text processed via the EthiCopy Engine is encrypted using AES-256 and TLS 1.3.
3.  **No Bias Guarantee**: Our AI models are audited quarterly for demographic and socio-economic bias.

---

## 🚪 The "Clear Exit" Principle
Unlike many SaaS providers, EthiCopy prohibits "Roach Motel" behavior.
- **Instant Export**: Export all historical audits in clean CSV/JSON.
- **One-Click Deletion**: We do not require a phone call or multiple "Are you sure?" screens to close an account.
- **Subscription Transparency**: We notify you 7 days before any recurring charge.

## ⚖️ Regulatory Alignment
Our engine is calibrated against the highest global standards:
- **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)** Guidance on Deceptive Marketing.
- **EU Digital Services Act (DSA)** & **AI Act**.
- **OECD** Guidelines for Consumer Protection in E-commerce.
